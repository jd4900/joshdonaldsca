I am a graduating Chemical Engineer from UBC. Born and raised in Kelowna, BC, my hobbies include snowboarding, playing bass guitar, "attempting" to program, and drinking (or making) beer. 

I am currently seeking fulltime employment while working on some side projects such as contracting work for [Craft Metrics](https://www.craftmetrics.ca), and assisting with projects with UBC Research Group [The Biofoundry](http://biofoundry.sites.olt.ubc.ca/). I am teaching myself some general DevOps skill such as Docker, working on a Natural Language Processing project (more coming soon), and designing a Virtual Simulation Lab.
