      <description>I am a graduating Chemical Engineer from UBC. Born and raised in Kelowna, BC, my hobbies include snowboarding, playing bass guitar, &amp;ldquo;attempting&amp;rdquo; to program, and drinking (or making) beer.
I am currently seeking fulltime employment while working on some side projects such as contracting work for Craft Metrics, and assisting with projects with UBC Research Group The Biofoundry. I am teaching myself some general DevOps skill such as Docker, working on a Natural Language Processing project (more coming soon), and designing a Virtual Simulation Lab.</description>
